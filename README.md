This is a port of [shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks).

shadowsocks is a fast tunnel proxy that helps you <del>bypass firewalls</del>.

> **THIS PROJECT IS <u>ONLY FOR</u> TESTING THE AVAILABILITY AND USABILITY OF MY COROUTINE SERVER PROJECT.**

> **IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, PLEASE REFER TO `coio-rs` and `simplesched` PROJECT**.

It is **unstable**! If you encounter any problems, please open an issue.

## Dependencies

* libcrypto (OpenSSL)
* Rust nightly
* Cargo

## Usage

Build with [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io):

```bash
cargo build
```

Then `sslocal` and `ssserver` will appear in `./target`, it works similarly as the two binaries of
the official shadowsocks' implementation.

Enable more crypto algorithms by passing the name `cipher-[name]` via command line argument `--features`

```bash
cargo build --features "cipher-aes-ctr"
```

Read `Cargo.toml` for more details.

*Require `libcrypto` by default.*

## Getting Started

Create a shadowsocks' configuration file. Example

```json
{
    "server": "my_server_ip",
    "server_port": 8388,
    "local_address": "127.0.0.1",
    "local_port": 1080,
    "password": "mypassword",
    "timeout": 300,
    "method": "aes-256-cfb"
}
```

Detailed explaination could be found in [shadowsocks' documentation](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/wiki).

In shadowsocks-rust, we also have an extended configuration file format, which is able to define more than one servers:

```json
{
    "servers": [
        {
            "address": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 1080,
            "password": "hello-world",
            "method": "bf-cfb",
            "timeout": 300,
        },
        {
            "address": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 1081,
            "password": "hello-kitty",
            "method": "aes-128-cfb"
        }
    ],
    "local_port": 8388,
    "local_address": "127.0.0.1"
}
```

The `sslocal` will use a load balancing algorithm to dispatch packages to all servers.

Start local and server shadowsocks with

```
cargo run --bin sslocal -- -c config.json
cargo run --bin ssserver -- -c config.json
```

List all available arguments with `-h`.

## Useful Tools

1. `socks5-tool` is to demonstrate how to write a Socks5 client.

2. `ssurl` is for encoding and decoding ShadowSocks URLs. Example: `ss://YWVzLTI1Ni1jZmI6aGVsbG93b3JsZF9mdWNrQDEyNy4wLjAuMTo4Mzg4`

## Notes

It supports the following features:

* CONNECT, UDP ASSOCIATE commands
* Crypto algorithms defined in `Cargo.toml`
* **Load balancing**

Currently it uses [coio-rs](https://github.com/zonyitoo/coio-rs) as the backend support library and it does not support Windows, <del>LoL</del>.

## TODO

- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] <del>`BIND` command</del>
- [ ] Socks5 authentication
- [x] Extend configuration format
- [ ] Fully testing on servers
- [ ] Performance testing and improvement
- [ ] User management
- [ ] <del>PAC</del>
- [x] Improved logging format (waiting for the new official log crate)
- [ ] Support more ciphers without depending on `libcrypto` (waiting for an acceptable Rust crypto lib implementation)
- [ ] Windows support. Depending on Mio and Coio-rs.
- [ ] Build with stable.
